## ✅ Problem 1: Swap Two Numbers

### Description
Swap the values of two variables using different approaches in JavaScript.

### Approaches

1. **Using a Temporary Variable**  
   Simple and easy-to-understand method.

2. **Using ES6 Array Destructuring**  
   A modern and concise approach using ES6 syntax.

3. **Using Arithmetic Operations (No Temp Variable)**  
   Swaps the numbers using addition and subtraction (no third variable used).

## ✅ Problem 2: Largest of Three Numbers

### Description
Find the Largest of 3 Numbers.

### Approaches

1. **Conditional Comparison Approach**  
   Uses if-else statements to manually compare each number..

2. **Math & Array-Based Approach**  
   Uses Math.max(...array) with array functions to determine the greatest value and optionally handle ties.

## ✅ Problem 3: Even Numbers

### Description
Print only Even numbers between 1 and 50.

### Approaches

1. **Conditional Check Approach**  
   Loops through every number in the range and uses an if statement to check if the number is even (i % 2 === 0).

2. **Optimized Incremental Approach**  
   Starts from the first even number in the range and increases the counter by 2 each time to directly reach the next even number.
